# odin-recipes
My first project at The Odin Project curriculum.
This is my first website ever! Its a Recipes website with 3 recipes, each one has basic HTML elements: Boilerplate, Headers, Paragraphs, Ordered and Unordered Lists, Images and links.
I learned how does basic websites are made with HTML.
